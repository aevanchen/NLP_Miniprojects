1.In order to run all the models, you need to run Preprocess.ipynb first.

Baseline model zip file includes:
2.Model 1 is InferSent with Semantic Similarity. You can run MODEL2.ipynb for model 1.
3.Model 2 is InferSent with our own Syntactic Similarity score along with Semantic Similarity score and logistic regression. You can run MODEL2.ipynb for model 2.
4.Model 3 is Bidirectional LSTM Encoders with Neural Net. You can run MODEL3.ipynb for model 3.

Final zip file includes:
5.Model 4 is Logistic Regression and Random Forest on feature based approach using similarity scores, POS and other metrics. You can run MODEL4.ipynb for model 4.
6.Model 5 is Using Bidirectional GRUs with Attention. You can run MODEL5.ipynb for model 5. rnnlayer.py is attention function we have referred from a github link https://github.com/wentaozhu/recurrent-attention-for-QA-SQUAD-based-on-keras.
